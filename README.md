Human or AI? – A Mini Turing Test Game


📌 Description

Human or AI? is a web-based game inspired by the Turing Test.
Players are shown answers to various questions and must guess whether each answer was written by a human or generated by an AI.

The project is an evolution of my CS50P final project and was rebuilt as a full web application using Flask for CS50x. It combines backend logic, frontend design, session management, and API usage into a single interactive experience.

🎮 How the Game Works

1.The player starts the game and enters their name.

2.The game consists of 5 rounds.

3.In each round:

A question is selected randomly.

An answer is shown, written either by:

a human (from a curated dataset), or

an AI (generated live using the Gemini API).

The player guesses whether the answer is Human (H) or AI (A).

4.The game keeps track of:

current round

score

5.After 5 rounds:

the final score is displayed

results can be saved to a leaderboard (SQLite).

To prevent timing from giving away the answer, human responses include a small random delay so they feel similar to AI responses.

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

Flask

HTML / CSS / Bootstrap

SQLite (for scoreboard)

Google Gemini API (AI-generated answers)

Sessions (game state management)

🔑 API Setup (Required)

This project uses the Gemini API.

Before running the app, set your API key:

app.py/helpers.py: client = genai.Client(api_key="Your-API-Key-Here")

▶️ Running the Application

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Flask app:

flask run


Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

🧪 Testing

The core logic was originally developed and tested in the CS50P version of the project.
For the CS50x version, functionality was validated through manual testing of gameplay, routing, session handling, and database interactions.

💡 Design Decisions

Sessions instead of loops:
Since Flask is request-based, the original CLI loop was converted into a route-based flow using sessions.

Separate game logic:
Core logic is separated from Flask routes for clarity and maintainability.

Human answer dataset:
Human answers are stored locally in qa.json to ensure realism and consistency.

Timing normalization:
Artificial delays prevent users from identifying answers based on response speed.
